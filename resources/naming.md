Naming REST endpoints consistently and clearly is crucial for building a well-structured, intuitive API. Here are some best practices for naming REST endpoints:
### 1. Use Nouns for Resource Names
Endpoints should represent resources, not actions. Use nouns to describe the resource you're interacting with.
*Example:*
- Correct: /books
- Incorrect: /getBooks
### 2. Use Plural Nouns for Collections
When dealing with a collection of resources, use plural nouns.
*Example:*
- Correct: /books
- Incorrect: /book
### 3. Use Hierarchical Structure for Nested Resources
If a resource is a sub-resource of another, reflect this in the URL hierarchy.
*Example:*
- /books/1/authors (authors of book with ID 1)
- /users/123/orders (orders of user with ID 123)
### 4. Use HTTP Methods for Actions
Rely on HTTP methods to specify actions, not the URL.
*Example:*
- GET /books - Retrieves a list of books
- POST /books - Creates a new book
- GET /books/1 - Retrieves a specific book
- PUT /books/1 - Updates a specific book
- DELETE /books/1 - Deletes a specific book
### 5. Keep It Simple and Intuitive
Endpoints should be easy to understand and guess.
*Example:*
- /books - Retrieves a list of books
- /authors - Retrieves a list of authors
### 6. Use Hyphens for Readability
Use hyphens (-) to improve readability of endpoint names. Avoid underscores (_), which can be harder to read.
*Example:*
- Correct: /user-accounts
- Incorrect: /user_accounts
### 7. Avoid File Extensions
Do not include file extensions like .json or .xml in endpoint URLs. Content negotiation should be handled via HTTP headers.
*Example:*
- Correct: /books
- Incorrect: /books.json
### 8. Version Your API
Include the version number of your API in the URL to allow for future changes.
*Example:*
- /api/v1/books
- /api/v2/books
### 9. Consistency is Key
Maintain a consistent naming convention throughout your API. This helps users of your API understand and predict the endpoints.
### Example Structure
Hereâ€™s an example structure incorporating these best practices:
plaintext
GET /api/v1/books - Retrieves a list of books
POST /api/v1/books - Creates a new book
GET /api/v1/books/{id} - Retrieves a specific book
PUT /api/v1/books/{id} - Updates a specific book
DELETE /api/v1/books/{id} - Deletes a specific book

GET /api/v1/authors - Retrieves a list of authors
POST /api/v1/authors - Creates a new author
GET /api/v1/authors/{id} - Retrieves a specific author
PUT /api/v1/authors/{id} - Updates a specific author
DELETE /api/v1/authors/{id} - Deletes a specific author

GET /api/v1/books/{bookId}/authors - Retrieves authors of a specific book
POST /api/v1/books/{bookId}/authors - Adds an author to a specific book
### Summary

- Use plural nouns for collections.
- Reflect resource hierarchy.
- Use HTTP methods for actions.
- Keep endpoints simple and intuitive.
- Use hyphens for readability.
- Avoid file extensions.
- Version your API.
- Maintain consistency.
Following these best practices helps ensure your API is well-structured, easy to understand, and maintainable.
